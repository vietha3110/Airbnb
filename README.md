# Welcome to HAAIRBNB

Haairbnb is a website clone, inspired by Airbnb. Haairbnb is an online booking app that lets the user listing their house/condo for vacation rentals and tourism activities. Currently, user can create, update, delete and view their listing and also leave a review to other spots (Reservation feature is coming soon.)

It is a fullstack Postgres, Node, React, Redux, CSS application. The majority of the application logic occurs within front end's Redux store and it uses pure css for styling components.

The backend serves the frontend, responds to frontend requests, and fetches data from the Postgres database.
